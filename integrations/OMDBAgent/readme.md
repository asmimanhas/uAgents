**OMDB API Integration with uAgents**

**Description**: This project integrates the OMDB API with uAgents, where agents perform various tasks related to movie details, genre filtering, sentiment collection, and review retrieval. The system aims to enhance the user experience by providing comprehensive movie recommendations based on genre preferences, viewer sentiments, and brief reviews.

**Details**
When a user provides the title of a movie, the system fetches details from the OMDB database, including information such as director, genre, IMDb rating, plot synopsis, and more. This ensures that users have access to essential information about the movies they are interested in.

**Filtering**
The system offers filtering options based on both genres and reviews. Users can specify their preferred movie genres to receive recommendations tailored to their tastes. Additionally, users can provide brief descriptions or keywords that capture the overall feel of a movie. The system utilizes these descriptions to filter and recommend movies that match the provided criteria, enabling users to find movies that resonate with them beyond just genre classification.

**Prompt**
Users are prompted to provide sentiments and reviews in a concise format. The sentiment prompt asks users whether they liked or disliked the movie, allowing for the collection of binary sentiment data (0 for dislike, 1 for like). Additionall, users are encouraged to provide short reviews that succinctly describe their impressions of the movie. These reviews help enrich the recommendation process by capturing subjective insights and preferences beyond simple genre preferences.

With the integration of OMDB API and uAgents, this project aims to offer users a more personalized and insightful movie recommendation experience. Whether users are seeking specific genre recommendations, looking for movies with certain characteristics, or sharing their sentiments and reviews, the system strives to cater to their preferences and enhance their movie-watching journey.
